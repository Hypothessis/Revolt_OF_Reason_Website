                    For me, who has always been a fan of video games and has always been very curious, this project will be
                    an opportunity to learn the structure of a game, understand how their design is, and see all the aspects.
                    This project will also push me to code and thus to progress. In conclusion, this project will satisfy me with
                    understanding how the design work for the games that I particularly appreciate. It will also allow me to
                    progress significantly in programming and algorithmic.

                    Like most people in EPITA, I spent my childhood playing video games. I naturally got interested in video game
                    making. Like Alexis, I began with Scratch in junior high school before moving to more usual programming
                    languages like JavaScript or C++. This project is exciting because video game making is a vast field. That
                    allows us to get involved in different sides of a video game: from coding to modeling and game design.
                    Furthermore, it will be the first project of EPITA that I can show to the people around me, whether they are
                    familiar with the IT world or not.

                    I am a stranger to the world of video games. However, I am highly invested
                    and motivated in the Revolt of Reason project.Since I was young, I did different internships, among which I learned how to create
                    a small machine. Doing the project in English allowed me to test my skills and improve them. It will allow me to discover the world of video games 
                    which remains fascinating from a technological point of view. In any case, this project has everything to teach me about myself and what interests me.

                    From my standpoint, I never have been in the world of video games. However, I have recently started to
                    get interested in this universe. I already had the opportunity to see how some games work, like Uncharted.
                    That contributed to my curiosity to discover more about it. In my view, the creation of this project will be
                    the expected opportunity to get into the gears and become aware of the troubles and solutions of this world
                    through our plan. In addition, that will allow me to improve my abilities in a big way in programming and, of
                    course, in algorithmic.
